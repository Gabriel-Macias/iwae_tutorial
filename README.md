# Study on Importance Weighted Variational Autoencoders (IWAE)

The jupyter notebook included in this repository covers an implementation of Importance Weighted Autoencoders (IWAE) as detailed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00519.

The implementation is done in `Tensorflow 2.1.0` and tested on the binarized `MNIST` dataset.

The following theoretical and experimental explorations are covered in this implementation:
* Theory behind IWAE
* Choice of initialization strategy
* Representation learning capabilities of IWAE
* Effect of tighter IWAE bounds
* Large-scale IWAE bound performance
